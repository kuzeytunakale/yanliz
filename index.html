    <p>Far over the misty mountains cold </br>
To dungeons deep and caverns old</br>
We must away, ere break of day</br>
To seek our pale enchanted gold</br>
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells</br>
While hammers fell like ringing bells</br>
In places deep, where dark things sleep</br>
In hollow halls beneath the fells</br>
For ancient king and elvish lord</br>
There many a gleaming golden hoard</br>
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught</br>
To hide in gems on hilt of sword</br>
On silver necklaces they strung</br>
The flowering stars on crowns they hung</br>
The dragon-fire in twisted wire</br>
They meshed the light of moon and sun</br>
Far over the misty mountains cold</br>
To dungeons deep and caverns old</br>
We must away, ere break of day</br>
To claim our long-forgotten gold</br>
Goblets they carved there for themselves</br>
And harps of gold, where no man delves</br>
There lay they long, and many a song</br>
Was sung unheard by men or elves</br>
The pines were roaring on the heights</br>
The winds was moaning in the night</br>
The fire was red, it flaming spread</br>
The trees like torches blazed with light</br>
The bells were ringing in the dale</br>
And men looked up with faces pale</br>
The dragon's ire, more fierce than fire</br>
Laid low their towers and houses frail</br>
The mountain smoked beneath the moon</br>
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom (tramp of doom)</br>
They fled their hall to dying fall</br>
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon</br>
Far over the misty mountains grim</br>
To dungeons deep and caverns dim</br>
We must away, ere break of day</br>
To win our harps and gold from him</br>
Far over the misty mountains cold</br>
To dungeons deep and caverns old</br></p>
